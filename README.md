# Code Vanguard: A Serious Game for Learning C# Programming

**Code Vanguard** is a serious game developed as part of my master's thesis. It combines programming education with engaging gameplay in a dystopian cyberpunk setting. Players join the **Code Vanguard Program**, tasked with fixing corrupted code across a damaged moonbase after a solar flare, learning C# fundamentals through hands-on coding challenges.

## 🎮 Features
- In-game C# code editing and compilation
- Feedback generated utilizing syntax tree representation of user-code
- Immersive learning experience targeting higher levels of Bloom's Taxonomy

## 🧠 Purpose
This project explores how serious games can be designed to teach programming at deeper cognitive levels, going beyond basic syntax to more advanced programming concepts.

## 📖 Thesis
The full thesis, _"Code Vanguard: A Serious Game for Learning C# Programming"_, discusses the game design, educational strategies, and evaluation results.

## 🛠️ Built With
- Unity
- C#
- Roslyn C# Runtime Compiler

## 📬 About
Created by Matthias Mitschele as part of the master's program at Technische Universität München.
